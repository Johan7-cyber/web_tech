	<p>about me: In my free time I like to read books, watching and recording funny videos, make parties, drawing 3D pictures. My passion is football. One of the greatest sports of all time. The motherland of football is England. The coolest feature of this game is that ypu can play with friends not only in a pitch, but also online, by computer or Playstation. In the end you get an unforgettable emotions, that stay forlife. Also Remember, Football is for life.</p>

	<li>Computer Systems Architecture and Operating Systems</li>	
<ul>
	<li>This course is taught to second-year students who major in computer science. The goal of the course is to give an introduction to how operating systems and hardware work under the hood, which is essential for general computer science literacy. This knowledge will help better understand the performance of software systems and create more efficient solutions.</li>
	</ol>
</font>
<font color="red">
<ol>
	<li>Critical Thinking</li>
<ul>
	<li>CT courses emphasize conscious development of a few key skills by active learning rather than the accumulation of knowledge by memorization. They do so by helping students develop those skills though varied pedagogical methods that professors specify.</li>
	</ol>
</font>
<font color="silver">
<ol>
	<li>Statistics</li>
<ul>
	<li>A statistics course may cover data collection, p-values, statistical inference, Excel formulas, confidence intervals, random variables, distributions, and more.</li>
	</ol>
</font>
<font color="navy">
<ol>
	<li>Programming</li>
<ul>
	<li>Problem solving and algorithm development. Computer hardware and software.
Introduction to programming: machine, assembly and high level languages. C programming
language. Arithmetic and logical statements, data types, input/output, basic control
structures(selection, iteration etc).Array data type and usage of character strings. Functions: Callby-value and call-by-reference, scopes, recursion. Structures. Pointers. Bit manipulation. File
processing.</li>
	</ol>
</font>

<ol>
	<li>Environment, Labour and Civil Protection</li>
<ul>
	<li>The main idea of this course is to introduce the advanced tehnologies underlying informaton Labour Safety, Civil Defence and Environment Protection. This course is designed to build on the basic principles of labour safety/crises situations management to help students gain an in-depth understanding of the labour safety process, cricys situation management and develop the knowledge needed to understand ability to independently apply means of individulny and collective protection, ability to independently estimate possible risks and to plan the actions in critical situations.</li>
	</ol>
</font>
<font color="fushsia">
<ol>
	<li>Mathematics</li>
<ul>
	<li>Mathematics 1 focuses primarily on linear equations and functions. Students will spend the majority of their time studying equivalent expressions, linear equations and inequalities, and systems of linear equations and inequalities. Student will spend some additional time studying properties of exponents and radicals, irrational numbers, and/or basic polynomial arithmetic (including factoring) to reinforce concepts from 8th grade and/or prepare students for Mathematics 2. The course will also include supporting topics from geometry and statistics. These supporting topics include single-variable data analysis, bivariate data analysis, angles and segments, angle relationships, angle relationships with parallel lines, coordinate geometry, and geometric transformations.</li>
